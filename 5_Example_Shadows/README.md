	This example is hardly based on the example
	openFrameworks\examples\gl\shadowsExample 
	from the OF Core made by @NickHardeman.
	We will learn how to replace easily their OF materials 
	with standalone materials that the addon includes, 
	in this case will be standalone:
	all the rest of the environment will remain un-touched 
	from the example, this means that we will not use 
	the lights modules from the addon bigger classes like
	ofxSurfingPBR or SurfingSceneManager neither: 
	only the "vanilla" classes that bundles the OF Core will be used 
	besides of the material class instances for ach scene element.
